                  <p>I provide both brand strategy and content strategy. In the first case I help organisations express, clearly and consistently, who they are and what they stand for. With content strategy, I work with brands to identify where and how to talk to their audiences. Below is a sample of agencies and organisations I've had the pleasure fof working with.</p>

                  <p>Words are my bread and butter. In my spare time, I love to get a mouthful of them, let the flavours sit on my tongue so that later I can serve up the perfect word at the right moment. I started my professional career teaching English, Journalism and Media Studies in High School. I've since worked in-house or freelance in advertising and marketing, journalism, education, and ecommerce and the web.</p>

                  <p>I specialize in customization and web development for clients who want to turn their website into a thriving Shopify e-commerce store. The work allows me to combine my design, UX and copywriting skills—that I developed in-house at lululemon and SHOES.COM—with my programming skills and in-depth knowledge of Shopify's platform.</p>
